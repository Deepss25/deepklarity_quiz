    "summary": "An operating system (OS) is system software that manages computer hardware and software resources, providing common services for computer programs. The article defines OS, discusses its core component (the kernel), and outlines various types including multicomputer, distributed, embedded, real-time, hypervisor, and library operating systems. It also covers the market share of popular OSs as of September 2024, noting Android as the most popular, followed by Microsoft Windows, iOS/iPadOS, macOS, and Linux. The text highlights the specific characteristics and applications of different OS types, such as the exact timing requirements of hard real-time systems and the virtual machine capabilities of hypervisors.",
